# Understand Problem and Solution
# problem: you know each single linkage of parent to child,
# but you do not know how far it is from each 'root'
# to each tree-terminal-grand-child

# approach 1:
# step 1: figure out the roots
# step 2: try each root searching for the goal-child and record the distance
# step 3: compare lengths and pick the root with
# longest rout (or the lowest number in a tie)
